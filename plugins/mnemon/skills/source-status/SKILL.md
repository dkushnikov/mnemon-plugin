# /source-status — Knowledge Library Dashboard

Show a summary of the knowledge library: total sources, breakdown by status/origin/domain, and recent additions.

## Usage

```
/source-status
```

No parameters needed.

## How to Execute

Call the gateway status action:

```bash
${MNEMON_HOME:-~/Mnemon}/bin/knowledge-gateway.sh status
```

The gateway outputs a formatted dashboard. Display it to the user.

If additional detail is needed (the gateway shows basics), you can augment with:

```bash
# Count by origin
source ${MNEMON_HOME:-~/Mnemon}/bin/mnemon-config.sh && load_config
for f in "$VAULT_PATH"/Sources/*/extract.md; do
  grep -m1 '^origin:' "$f" 2>/dev/null
done | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Count by domain
for f in "$VAULT_PATH"/Sources/*/extract.md; do
  grep -m1 '^domains:' "$f" 2>/dev/null
done | tr '[],' '\n' | sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//' | grep -v '^$' | grep -v '^domains:' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```
